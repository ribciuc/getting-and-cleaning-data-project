* codebook.md
* README.md

Run the R run_analysis.R script to perform the following actions over the UCI HAR Dataset:

* Merge test and train from x,y and subject data
* Extract only the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
* Appropriately labels the dataset with descriptive variable names
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Group by activity and subject, aggregate by average and create a tidy csv from the result
